Based on python(2.7)----Pacman game

You will get setup to run the Pacman game that will be the basis of the corsework for the module, and write your first code to control
Pacman.

Since the work on Pacman will include working with Python, these instructions also have some pointers to Python resources, which may be helpful, and details of how to install Python on thelab
machiens should you need to do that.

Start with Python

Python has been installed on the Informatics computing environment. As a result, you should beable to run it directly. 
Try this:
1. Boot the lab machine into CentOS Linux (this is default)
2. Log in.
3. Open a Terminal window.
4. Type:
python
on the command line.

You should get something like this:

Python 2.7.12 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (64-bit)| (default, Jul 2 2016, 17:42:40)
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
Anaconda is brought to you by Continuum Analytics.
Please check out: http://continuum.io/thanks and https://anaconda.org
>>>

And the version of Python installed in the lab1 is 2.7.5, but you should be able to see the Python environment starting up and reporting for duty.
